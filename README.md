## Usage

This website helped list the essential initial programming components needed to build a basic website and consolidated important notes that are handy to have on hand. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first. For now, we don't need to add an image, so you can delete that part.
